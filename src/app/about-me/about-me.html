        Hi! I'm Stacy, a full-stack software developer who's taken the scenic route to find my dream
        career. After spending fifteen-plus years building a successfull career in the insurance
        industry, I knew I needed a change. That's when I discovered a passion for programming that
        completely reshaped my career goals. What started as a hobby quickly became a calling, and I
        eventually made the leap into software development the full-stack program at Grand Circus
        Bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, in my career so far, I've had the opportunity to work with tools like Angular, React,
        Typescript, Java, REST APIs, and SQL to build intuitive, scalable applications that make
        people's live more interesting and easier. I love the challenge of turning complex problems
        into clean, thoughtful solutions. Most of my experience has centered around frontend
        architecture, user experience, and creating products that feel effortless to use.

        But the heart of who I am isn't just code. I'm a wife to a loving supportive husband, and a
        mother to two wonderful kids, and they're a big part of what motivates me to keep learning,
        growing, and building things that genuinely help people. When I'm not working, you'll likely
        find me outside or curled up on the coach with a good book. I'm happiest camping or biking
        in the summer, sitting around a bonfire in the fall, or sledding with my family in the
        winter. Michigan weather keeps things interesting, and I love every season for what it
        brings.

        My journey into tech may not have been a direct path, but it has given me a unique blend of
        empathy, business maturity, and technical skills. I know what it's like to navigate change,
        learn fast, and never give up, and that perspective shapes every problem I approach.
      </p>
